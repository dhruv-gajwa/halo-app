 * Phase-specific notes:
 *   - Phase 2 adds real /signin and /signup routes. The Anchor links below are
 *     intentionally non-functional in Phase 1 — they confirm the Landing component
 *     is rendering as the index of `/` and provide visible placeholders.
 *   - Phase 1 uses Mantine's <Anchor> directly. Plan 06 (UI primitives) has not
 *     run yet in the wave order, so the wrapped primitive is not available here.
