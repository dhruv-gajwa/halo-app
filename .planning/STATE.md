# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-13)

**Core value:** A convincing, multi-page SaaS surface that a Pendo customer or pre-sales engineer can install Pendo into and exercise track events & funnels, guides & in-app messaging, feature adoption analytics, and Session Replay & Listen — all without a backend.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Cross-Cutting Contracts

## Current Position

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Mantine 7 + Recharts + Zustand + RHF/Zod stack settled (see research/STACK.md)
- Init: Horizontal-layers project mode chosen — cross-cutting Pendo plumbing, selector registry, and versioned localStorage envelope land in Phase 1 before any page is built
- Init: Multi-step registration ships as four distinct URLs (`/signup`, `/signup/details`, `/signup/company`, `/signup/preferences`) so Pendo can build a page-based funnel

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Verify current Pendo agent API surface against `support.pendo.io` at phase start — specifically snippet template, SPA route-tracking API (`pendo.location.setUrl` vs `pendo.pageLoad`), and Session Replay mask attribute name
- Phase 1: Pin exact npm package versions via `npm view <pkg> version` at install time (stack research ran without network access)
