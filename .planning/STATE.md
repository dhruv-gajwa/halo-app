# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-13)

**Core value:** A convincing, multi-page SaaS surface that a Pendo customer or pre-sales engineer can install Pendo into and exercise track events & funnels, guides & in-app messaging, feature adoption analytics, and Session Replay & Listen — all without a backend.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-cross-cutting-contracts

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-cross-cutting-contracts) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 6 (01-01 complete; next: Wave 2 — 01-02 and 01-03 run in parallel)
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-05-13 -- 01-01 scaffold verified; developer confirmed dev server boots cleanly

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Mantine 7 + Recharts + Zustand + RHF/Zod stack settled (see research/STACK.md). Phase-1 researcher updated to React 19 + Mantine 9 + Router 7 + Zod 4 + Zustand 5 + Vite 8 (CLAUDE.md explicitly allowed "or 19.x if stable"; Mantine 9 forces React 19).
- Init: Horizontal-layers project mode chosen — selector registry and versioned localStorage envelope land in Phase 1 before any page is built
- Init: Multi-step registration ships as four distinct URLs (`/signup`, `/signup/details`, `/signup/company`, `/signup/preferences`)
- 2026-05-13: User decision — defer all Pendo *runtime* (PEN-01..06) to a new end-of-milestone Phase 6 ("Pendo Install & Wiring"). Phases 1–5 build a Pendo-*ready* app (selector registry, `data-pendo-id` markup contract, SVG-only charting convention, masked-input primitive with `.pendo-sr-ignore` class) without any live Pendo wiring. Provider stack reserves the `PendoBridge` slot as a no-op pass-through stub.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Verify current Pendo agent API surface against `support.pendo.io` at phase start — specifically snippet template, SPA route-tracking API (`pendo.location.setUrl` vs `pendo.pageLoad`), and Session Replay mask attribute name
- Phase 1: Pin exact npm package versions via `npm view <pkg> version` at install time (stack research ran without network access)
