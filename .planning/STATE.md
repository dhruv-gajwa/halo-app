# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-13)

**Core value:** A convincing, multi-page SaaS surface that a Pendo customer or pre-sales engineer can install Pendo into and exercise track events & funnels, guides & in-app messaging, feature adoption analytics, and Session Replay & Listen — all without a backend.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — registration-sign-in

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (registration-sign-in) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 10
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-14

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Mantine 7 + Recharts + Zustand + RHF/Zod stack settled (see research/STACK.md). Phase-1 researcher updated to React 19 + Mantine 9 + Router 7 + Zod 4 + Zustand 5 + Vite 8 (CLAUDE.md explicitly allowed "or 19.x if stable"; Mantine 9 forces React 19).
- Init: Horizontal-layers project mode chosen — selector registry and versioned localStorage envelope land in Phase 1 before any page is built
- Init: Multi-step registration ships as four distinct URLs (`/signup`, `/signup/details`, `/signup/company`, `/signup/preferences`)
- 2026-05-13: User decision — defer all Pendo *runtime* (PEN-01..06) to a new end-of-milestone Phase 6 ("Pendo Install & Wiring"). Phases 1–5 build a Pendo-*ready* app (selector registry, `data-pendo-id` markup contract, SVG-only charting convention, masked-input primitive with `.pendo-sr-ignore` class) without any live Pendo wiring. Provider stack reserves the `PendoBridge` slot as a no-op pass-through stub.
- [Phase ?]: FND-07 satisfied: provider stack assembled as thin Phase 1 stubs (Storage→Auth→Workspace→PendoBridge); each phase replaces provider body without touching App.tsx
- [Phase ?]: 01-05: react-router@7.15 installed (unified react-router package); two-layout route split (/ PublicLayout + /app AppLayout); DemoBanner on public layout only; Phase 6 PendoRouteBridge slot reserved via TODO comments
- [Phase ?]: PasswordInput applies .pendo-sr-ignore CSS class (NOT data-pendo-mask attribute) per Pendo SDK 2.324.0 verified source
- [Phase 02-01]: Kept multi-line type-alias shape on new primitives (mirrors Phase 1 TextInput.tsx canonical); Task 2 single-line AC regex documented as plan-internal inconsistency in 02-01-SUMMARY Deviations
- [Phase 02-01]: signup.* PENDO_IDS organized by step number (step1..step4) not URL slug — registry mirrors wizard narrative regardless of URL choices
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-02: Zod 4 idiomatic z.iso.datetime + chained z.string().min(1, msg).email(msg) preferred over deprecated z.string().datetime() (only chained form attaches distinct empty-vs-malformed messages)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-02: User = Visitor as structural type alias (not interface re-export); AuthProvider keeps its inline narrower User until Plan 02-05 rewrites it — types coexist safely
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-02: Form-step + signin schemas not re-exported through storage barrel; uniqueness + credential-mismatch errors are page-handler concerns, not Zod refinements
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-03: authRepo enforces zero direct localStorage.* — every read goes through readWithSchema(K.x(), XSchema, []) so corrupt/tampered values fall through to [] (FND-04 compliance, smoke-asserted)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-03: createVisitor returns Visitor with only passwordHash — TypeScript-enforced via explicit destructure + Visitor return type; smoke asserts no plaintext in returned record nor in stored JSON
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-03: nanoid@^5.1.11 pinned; supplies Visitor.id and Workspace.id (locks CLAUDE.md 'nanoid for Pendo visitor+account IDs' contract for Phase 6 PendoBridge)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Verify current Pendo agent API surface against `support.pendo.io` at phase start — specifically snippet template, SPA route-tracking API (`pendo.location.setUrl` vs `pendo.pageLoad`), and Session Replay mask attribute name
- Phase 1: Pin exact npm package versions via `npm view <pkg> version` at install time (stack research ran without network access)
